# YSDN Admin

A scrappy administration panel to help us collect work from our year. It's a [Vue](http://vuejs.org)-powered form interface with a few validations (image type, file size, dimensions, etc.) that's hooked up to a MongoDB API.

This API is then used to pull data for [the static site](https://github.com/ysdn-2016/ysdn-2016.github.io) when it gets built.
